Q3.
Prog2 has better design. Design of the prog1 is in my opininion
in contradiction with the principles of object oriented programming.
If all of the variables and functions are straightly accessible the
writing and reading of the code can get difficult. Keeping them seperate
makes it clear that objects have variables and functions and are separate parts
of the whole program

Q4.
The boolean functions are introduced but their return value doesn't seem to
used. The helper functions should all be private because outside world
shouldn't need access to them seperately. I would run the validateLocation
function in each read function so that only a one function should be called
